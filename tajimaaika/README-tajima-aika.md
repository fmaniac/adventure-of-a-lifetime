Tajima aika is a female rock climber from Japanese, who is really cute from my sight.
I first saw her in Xiameng when she was attending the IFSC climbing competition in 2018, however I didn't say a word to her for muliple reasons.
I am such a suck guy.
I create this project for this cute girl, to do the following things:
a. Learning Japanese. N1
b. Improving my rock climbing capability. 

I hope to see her again and get a chance to talk with her, just a few minutes is OK. 
Thank God I must've been crazy...
